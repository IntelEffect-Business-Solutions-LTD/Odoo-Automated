This script will first update the package list and upgrade the system. Then, it will install the necessary dependencies, including Python 3, pip, and PostgreSQL.

Next, the script will create a new user for the Odoo installation and use pip to install Odoo.

After that, the script will create a new configuration file for Odoo, which sets the password for the admin user and specifies the path to the Odoo addons directory.

Finally, the script will create a new systemd service file for Odoo, start the service, and enable it to start on boot.
